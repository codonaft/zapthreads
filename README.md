 - Markdown support and nostr reference handling
 - Extremely versatile and customizable
   - Enable/disable many features via attributes
   - Light/dark modes
   - Full styling control
   - Multiple languages (coming soon)
 - Lightweight on clients and relays
   - Local storage caching, offline-first
   - ~40kb minified/compressed with styles and assets (nocomment is > 240kb)
 - Available as web component or embeddable script
 - Auto thread collapsing for too long discussions
 - Optional comments filtering: NIP-13 PoW, spam block-listing, custom filtering

## Usage

```
npm install zapthreads
```

or

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/zapthreads/dist/zapthreads.iife.js"></script>
```

Then,

```html
import "zapthreads";

<zap-threads anchor="naddr1qqxnzd3cxqmrzv3exgmr2wfeqgsxu35yyt0mwjjh8pcz4zprhxegz69t4wr9t74vk6zne58wzh0waycrqsqqqa28pjfdhz" ... />
```

Arguments:

 - `anchor`:
   - Required!
   - NIP-19 naddr, note, nevent or URL from where to retrieve events
 - `version`
   - ID of the event to show in case a naddr (long-form note) has multiple versions
 - `relays`: comma-separated list of relays, unset by default (will not load any content)
   - if any relays are set in the NIP-07 extension â€” `relays` will be overwritten after logging in
 - `author`:
   - This npub will be added as a `p` tag to all comments
   - Useful for notifying the author of a website (http anchor)
 - `disable`: comma-separated string of features to disable, all enabled by default
   - `likes`
   - `votes`
   - `zaps`
   - `reply` (when disabled the component becomes read-only)
   - `publish` (when disabled does not send event to relays, useful for testing)
   - `watch` (when disabled queries relays and closes the connection immediately on EOSE)
   - `replyAnonymously` (when disabled requires logging in in order to publish)
   - `hideContent` (when disabled it shows the content if the anchor is a naddr)
   - `relayInformation` (when disabled NIP-11 relay filtering is off)
   - `spamNostrBand`
 - `urls`: comma-separated pairs of URLs
   - defaults to `naddr:nostr.com/,npub:nostr.com/,nprofile:nostr.com/,nevent:nostr.com/,note:nostr.com/,tag:snort.social/t/`
   - `https://` will be automatically prepended
 - `languages`: comma-separated string of allowed languages, no restrictions by default
   - ignores relays with unsupported languages
 - `max-comment-length`: limit comment length, disabled by default
 - `min-read-pow` and `max-write-pow`: difficulty boundaries that determine how warm we make our planet while desperately fighting spam, `0` by default
   - ignores events sent with difficulty less than `min-read-pow`
     - difficulty validation is done on client if any read relay doesn't implement NIP-13 or doesn't have required difficulty limitation
   - write pow difficulty is determined as maximum of
     - `min-read-pow`
     - current minimal pow of write relays limitations, bounded by `max-write-pow`
   - `anchor` difficulty is ignored, it can be `0`

```html
<zap-threads 
  anchor="naddr1qqxnzd3cxqmrzv3exgmr2wfeqgsxu35yyt0mwjjh8pcz4zprhxegz69t4wr9t74vk6zne58wzh0waycrqsqqqa28pjfdhz"
  relays="wss://relay.nostr.band,wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net/"
  disable="likes"
  />
