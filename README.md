# zapthreads-codonaft

NIP-07-only fork of original [ZapThreads](https://github.com/franzaps/zapthreads#readme) web commenting system built on Nostr.

Test it here: https://codonaft.com/improved-zapthreads

![](https://codonaft.com/assets/img/zapthreads-codonaft.webp)

## Main Changes
- [x] Voting for comments (Reddit and YouTube-like)
- [x] Comment removal
  - limited, comments won't disappear for those who already loaded them
- [x] Auto thread collapsing for too long discussions
- [x] Customizable comments filtering, sanitizing and ranking
  - by NIP-13 PoW, replies number, language, etc.
  - Replies are always sorted by time in ascending order
  - Optional filtering using [spam.nostr.band](https://spam.nostr.band)
- [x] Moderation (reporting and mute-listing, moderators retrieval from community)
- [x] Relays retrieval from NIP-07 browser extension and from NIP-65 relay list as fallback
- [x] Optional persistent user sessions
- [x] Optional relay capabilities testing using NIP-11
- [x] Callbacks for better website integration
- [x] Bugfixes and performance optimizations

Some of the stuff I may work on later:
- [ ] Voting for author's root post
- [ ] Label author's answers and reactions with avatar, similar to YouTube
- [ ] (API for) Logout button
- [ ] (API for) Follow author's profile button
- [ ] Show Report button when hovering on comment only
- [ ] Button that resends your comment to the previously failed relays
- [ ] Rank by reports from other users
- [ ] Fix comments and replies counters
  - currently they ignore filtered out (due to moderation) comments
- [ ] <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>‚Üµ</kbd> / <kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>‚Üµ</kbd> hotkey to reply
- [ ] Faster NIP-13 PoW implementation
- [ ] [Gossip](https://github.com/frnandu/yana/blob/master/GOSSIP.md) model
- [ ] Turn all animated avatars into static pictures, animate them on hover only
- [ ] Optional comment preview (GitHub-like)
- Zaps
    - [ ] Zap comment
    - [ ] Rank comments by zaps
- Moderation
    - [x] Approve messages written by users that are followed by current user/author/moderator by default
        - limited, may require page reload for now
    - [ ] Make moderated comments filtering instant
      - currently some lag is still possible
    - [ ] Blur images from comments reported as NSFW, unblur on hover
    - [ ] Blur avatars from users reported as NSFW, unblur on hover
    - [ ] Show comments with a negative vote rating more transparent
      - the lower the rating‚Äîthe lower opacity
      - normal opacity on hover

## Usage

```bash
npm i

node_modules/.bin/vite build
# node_modules/.bin/vite build --minify false --mode debug
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/zapthreads.iife.js"></script>

<zap-threads
  anchor="naddr1qqxnzd3cxqmrzv3exgmr2wfeqgsxu35yyt0mwjjh8pcz4zprhxegz69t4wr9t74vk6zne58wzh0waycrqsqqqa28pjfdhz"
  relays="wss://relay.nostr.band,wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net/"
  disable="likes,singleVoteCounter"
  />

<script>
ZapThreads.start();
</script>
```

Arguments:

 - `anchor`:
   - Required!
   - NIP-19 naddr, note, nevent or URL from where to retrieve events
 - `version`
   - ID of the event to show in case a naddr (long-form note) has multiple versions
 - `relays`: comma-separated list of relays, unset by default (will not load any content)
   - if any relays are set in the NIP-07 extension ‚Äî `relays` will be overwritten after logging in
 - `author`:
   - This npub will be added as a `p` tag to all comments
   - Useful for notifying the author of a website (http anchor)
 - `community`: retrieve trusted moderators from here
   - anchor author (including `author`) is automatically a moderator
   - comments reported by moderator and logged in user are hidden
 - `disable`: comma-separated string of features to disable, all enabled by default
   - `likes`
   - `votes`
   - `singleVoteCounter`
   - `zaps`
   - `reply` (when disabled the component becomes read-only)
   - `publish` (when disabled does not send event to relays, useful for testing)
   - `watch` (when disabled queries relays and closes the connection immediately on EOSE)
   - `hideContent` (when disabled it shows the content if the anchor is a naddr)
   - `relayInformation` (when disabled NIP-11 relay filtering is off)
   - `spamNostrBand`
   - `followIsApproval`
 - `urls`: comma-separated pairs of URLs
   - defaults to `naddr:nostr.at/,npub:nostr.at/,nprofile:nostr.at/,nevent:nostr.at/,note:nostr.at/,tag:snort.social/t/`
   - `https://` will be automatically prepended
 - `language`: allowed language, no restrictions by default
   - ISO-639-1 two-letter code only
   - ignores relays with unsupported language (unless `disable="relayInformation"` is set)
   - labels comments sent from the client with the language tag
     - note: there's no validation whether user actually sent message in this language, use `onEvent` to validate it
 - `client`: string with client name (like `zapthreads-codonaft` or your domain name, etc.)
   - adds client tag, unset by default
 - `max-comment-length`: limit comment length, disabled by default
 - `min-read-pow` and `max-write-pow`: difficulty boundaries that determine how warm we make our planet while desperately fighting spam, `0` by default
   - ignores events sent with difficulty less than `min-read-pow`
     - difficulty validation is done on client if any read relay doesn't implement NIP-13 or doesn't have required difficulty limitation
   - write pow difficulty is determined as maximum of
     - `min-read-pow`
     - current minimal pow of write relays limitations (unless `disable="relayInformation"` is set), bounded by `max-write-pow`
   - `anchor` difficulty is ignored, it can be `0`
   - such message will be visible even with too low PoW if moderator/author/current user follows the commenter
     - unless (`disable="followIsApproval"` is set)

### Callbacks
```js
ZapThreads
  .onLogin(async ({ knownUser }) => {
    if (!knownUser) {
      // annoy with consent dialog here
    }
    return { accepted: true, autoLogin: true };
  })
  .onRemove(async ({}) => {
    return { accepted: true };
  })
  .onReport(async ({}) => {
    return { accepted: true, list: 'event', type: 'other', reason: '' };
  })
  .onEvent(({ rankable, kind, content, replies, upvotes, downvotes, pow, language, client, followedByModerator }) => {
    if (kind === 1 && content.includes('poker')) {
      throw new Error("No spamming please, we're discussing important things here");
    }

    let rank;
    if (rankable) {
      rank = (content.length > 1000 ? -1 : 0) + (upvotes - downvotes) * 100;
    }

    return {
      sanitizedContent: content.replaceAll('perkele', 'mind-blowing'),
      showReportButton: content.includes('https://'),
      rank,
    };
  })
  .onPublish(async ({ relays }) => {
    if (relays.length === 0) {
      // no available write relays, perhaps they are not set
    }
    return { accepted: true };
  })
  .start();
```
